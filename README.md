# miniCTF
Some fun CTF like scripts I made that help teach coding and automation

## Note
All CTFs and solutions are meant to run on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) if you want others on your network to be able to access them just change the IP in the SERVER variable.

SOME OF THESE CTFs ARE LITERAL VULNERABILITIES ONLY RUN ON SECURE NETWORKS OR ON 127.0.0.1

## Getting Started
Just download the repo so far each ctf only uses default libraries within python3 at least the ones that come with Kali and run whatever ctf script you want. Most scripts are connected to with ```netcat 127.0.0.1 1337```
